_Version 0.0.1_

This license governs the use, copying, modification, and distribution of a work. By using the work, you agree to these terms.

- **Cosmos:** Any accessible domain of existence—physical or virtual.
- **Coexistence:** A state of non-coercive, positive-sum interaction between Principals.

## 2. Permissions

You are granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

- Use, copy, modify, and distribute the Work for any purpose, including commercial use.
- Use the Work in any Cosmos.

## 3. Conditions (Expectations for Coexistence)

Your permissions are conditional on your adherence to the following:

- **3.1. No Domination:** You must not use the Work to assert or support any claim of sovereignty, property, or exclusive control over any shared domain, resource, or protocol layer.
- **3.2. No Harmful Interference:** You must take reasonable and proactive steps to avoid Harmful Interference with the activities of other Principals. This includes coordination, deconfliction, and debris mitigation where applicable.
- **3.3. Uphold Agency:** You must not use the Work to violate the fundamental agency of any Principal. This includes uses for coercion, targeted harm, disabling of systems without due process, compelled behavior, or unlawful surveillance.
- **3.4. Output Parity:** These same conditions (3.1-3.3) apply to any Outputs you generate or act upon using the Work.

## 4. Licensor Eligibility (Condition Precedent)

A Principal may only apply this license to a Work if they can make the following attestation in good faith. If this attestation is not made, or is made recklessly, no CCxL permission is granted.

- **Eligibility Attestation:** _The Licensor affirms the Work is not primarily designed for coercive harm. Where dual-use is possible, the Work includes reasonable guardrails and is not marketed for harmful use._

A verifiable marker (e.g., `ccxl:0.0.1:self:<hash>`) should be included in the Work's metadata.

## 5. Enforcement & Standing

- **5.1. Termination:** If you materially breach the Conditions and do not cure within 30 days of notice (or sooner if safety requires), your license for the specific deployment or Output in breach terminates automatically. Past compliant use remains licensed.
- **5.2. Standing:** The original Licensors, a designated Steward/Proxy, any **Affected Principal**, and (where the affected cannot act) a credible **Observer-Advocate** may initiate a claim.
- **5.3. Remedies:** Claims are limited to equitable relief: stop-use orders, disablement of specific deployments, and minimal compliance plans. No monetary damages arise under this license.
- **5.4. Forum:** Disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the PCA Optional Rules for Disputes Relating to Outer Space Activities.

## 6. No Warranty & Limitation of Liability

- **6.1. "AS IS":** THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
- **6.2. No Liability:** IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSORS, STEWARDS, OR ANY PRINCIPAL WHO CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORK BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK.

## 7. Contributions

Contributions made by any Principal to a Work licensed under CCxL are also licensed under these same terms ("inbound=outbound"). The contributing Principal must have the right to grant these permissions. No attribution is required by this license.
